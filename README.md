# Excel-Sales-Dashboard
Developed a dynamic sales performance dashboard using Excel to analyze and visualize key business metrics, including sales trends, revenue growth, and regional performance. The dashboard integrates data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization techniques, enabling stakeholders to monitor KPIs such as total sales, average order value, and profit margins. Designed with interactive elements (slicers, drop-downs, charts), it allows for real-time filtering and deep dives into product categories, customer segments, and sales channels, supporting data-driven decision-making and performance optimization.
